//Maximum product subset of an array
/*
Example
Input: a[] = { -1, -1, -2, 4, 3 }
Output: 24
Explanation : Maximum product will be ( -2 * -1 * 4 * 3 ) = 24

Input: a[] = { -1, 0 }
Output: 0
Explanation: 0(single element) is maximum product possible

Input: a[] = { 0, 0, 0 }
Output: 0

/*
A better solution is to use the below facts.

1)If there are even number of negative numbers and no zeros,
result is simply product of all
2)If there are odd number of negative numbers and no zeros,
 result is product of all except the negative integer with
 the least absolute value.
3)If there are zeros, result is product of all except these zeros with one
exceptional case. The exceptional case is when there is one negative number
 and all other elements are 0. In this case, result is 0.

when N <= 10, then both O(N!) and O(2N) are ok (for 2N probably N <= 20 is ok too)
when N <= 100, then O(N3) is ok (I guess that N4 is also ok, but never tried)
when N <= 1.000, then N2 is also ok
when N <= 1.000.000, then O(N) is fine (I guess that 10.000.000 is fine too, but I never tried in contest)
finally when N = 1.000.000.000 then O(N) is NOT ok, you have to find something betterâ€¦*/
